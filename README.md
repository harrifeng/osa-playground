## Overview
Playground to understand and develop OpenStack Ansible.

## Getting Started
### Required Setup
This test bed uses Vagrant and VirtualBox running on an Ubuntu 14.04 host.  The VMs are also Ubuntu 14.04.  At the creation time of this project, Vagrant 1.7.2 was used and VirtualBox 4.3.36r105129.  Newer versions of these should work fine.

Once configured with Vagrant and VirtualBox on your host machine, please get the Ubuntu Vagrant box.
  `$ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64`
